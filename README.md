# USC Campus Safety Analysis

## Overview
This project provides a comprehensive data analytics and visualization of crime trends around the USC campus, utilizing a decade of LAPD crime data. The objective is to identify high-risk periods and locations, helping inform targeted security measures to enhance campus safety.

## Key Features
- **Data Analysis**: Analyzes temporal and geographic crime patterns to determine high-risk times and areas.
- **Visualizations**: Creates visual insights using Tableau to illustrate crime trends over time and across locations.
- **Recommendations**: Proposes actionable security measures based on identified crime hotspots and time patterns.

## Project Structure
- **Data Loading and Cleaning**: Loads and cleans LAPD crime data for accurate analysis.
- **Data Analysis**: Aggregates crime data by time, location, and type to identify significant patterns.
- **Visualization**: Uses Python and Tableau for generating charts and heatmaps to convey crime distribution insights.
- **Reporting**: Summarizes findings and presents recommendations for campus safety improvements.

## Technologies Used
- **Python**: For data preprocessing and analysis.
- **Tableau**: For visualizing and reporting on crime data trends.
- **Pandas**: For data manipulation and transformation.
- **Matplotlib**: For data visualization within the notebook.

## Installation
1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/sriramgurazada/usc-campus-safety-analysis.git

## Usage

- Load the LAPD crime data into the data/ folder.
- Run the Jupyter notebook Usc_campus_safety_analysis_main.ipynb for data cleaning, analysis, and visualizations.
- Open Tableau and load the output data for generating interactive crime trend visualizations.

## Project Insights

- High-Risk Times: Identified peak hours with elevated crime rates, helping in planning security patrols.
- Hotspot Analysis: Mapped out high-crime locations around the USC campus to prioritize resource allocation.
- Temporal Analysis: Provides a breakdown of crime rates by time of day and week for focused security measures.

**Results**
The analysis revealed significant patterns in crime occurrences around USC, highlighting specific locations and times that require increased security attention.
